**CODSOFT**
This repository contains three projects that illustrate fundamental programming concepts and algorithms in Python. Each project explores different areas of computer science and programming techniques.

Projects Overview
1. **Simple Chatbot**

**Description:**
 This project implements a basic rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs using predefined responses. It serves as an introduction to natural language processing and helps understand the flow of conversation in software applications.

**Key Concepts:**

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Control flow using conditional statements (if-else)
User interaction and response generation


**2. Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Graphical Interface**

**Description:**

This project features an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where players can compete against an unbeatable AI. The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal play. The game includes a user-friendly graphical interface built using Python's tkinter library.

**Key Concepts:**

Game theory and optimal strategies
Minimax algorithm and its implementation
Graphical User Interface (GUI) development with tkinter


**3. Telugu Movie Recommendation System**
**Description:** 
This project implements a recommendation system that suggests Telugu movies to users based on their ratings and preferences. Using user-based collaborative filtering, it finds similar users and recommends movies they have liked.

**Key Concepts:**

Collaborative filtering and recommendation systems
User similarity measurement using cosine similarity
Data handling and analysis with Python
